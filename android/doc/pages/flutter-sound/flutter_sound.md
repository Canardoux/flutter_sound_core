# τ under Flutter


## Flutter Sound

![](../logo/banner.png)

![pub version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_sound.svg?style=flat-square)

Flutter Sound is the first \(and actually the only\) implementation of the τ Project. This Flutter plugin is supported by :

* iOS
* Android
* Flutter Web

Maybe, one day, we will be supported by Linux, Macos, and even \(why not\) Windows. But this is not top of our priorities.

### Flutter Sound branches

We actually maintain two branches for Flutter Sound :

* The V6 branch \(the version ^6.0.0\)
* The master branch \(actually the version ^7.0.0\). The master branch can sometimes introduce backward compatibility issues and be sometime not completely stable.

### SDK requirements

* Flutter Sound requires an iOS 10.0 SDK \(or later\)
* Flutter Sound requires an Android 21 \(or later\)

### Examples \(Demo Apps\)

Flutter Sound comes with several Demo/Examples :

[The `examples App`](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound/blob/master/flutter_sound/example/lib/main.dart) is a driver which can call all the various examples.
